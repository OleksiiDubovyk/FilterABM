Description: An agent-based model that includes a simplified case of environmental filtering with one abstract trait, 
    one abstract environmental factor, and one abstract resource.
    The model attempts to predict the abundance and trait distribution in a local community shaped by the processes of community assembly, niche clustering, and dispersion.
